Hello fellow traveller!

After quite some time trying to build my website from scratch i got tired and decided to move to Jekyll since its way easier to use! 
I am currently using the carte-noir theme, i'm going to modify it as i see fit and i am going to use this blog as a means of sharing my knowledge, show off my resume (which is currently empty) and sometimes talk about some life experiences.

Hope you have a great day!
